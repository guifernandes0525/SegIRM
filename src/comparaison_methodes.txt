NC05 : 
+ very regular and visually pleasing superpixels 
- boundary adherence relatively poor
- one of the slowest
complexity of O (N^3/2) N : number of pixels

GS04 : 
+ adheres well to image boundaries in practice 
- produces superpoxels with very irregular sizes and shapes.
complexity of O(N log N)

TP09 : 
= constrained to have uniform size, compactness and boundary adherence
complexity of O(N)
one of the slowest algorithms
- poor boundary adherence

SL08 : 
complexity of O(N^(3/2)*logN)
sontrgly influence the quality and speed of the output

GCa10 and GCb10 : 
each pixel belongs to only one of the overlapping regions, two variants : 
GCa10 : for generating compact superpixels
GCb10 : for constant-intensity superpixels

QS08 : 
- quite slow
complexity of O(dN²) 
d : small constant
+ realtively good boundary adherence

WS91 : 
ofthen highly irregular in size and shape
- not good boundary adherence 
relatively fast O(N log N)
